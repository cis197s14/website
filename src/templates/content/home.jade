  ### Course Description

  This course provides an introduction to modern web development frameworks,
  techniques, and practices used to deliver robust client side applications on
  the web. The emphasis will be on developing JavaScript programs that run in
  the browser, not server-side applications in traditional languages like Java,
  Python, or Ruby.

  This course is most useful for students who have some programming and web
  development experience and want to develop moderate JavaScript skills to be
  able to build complex, interactive applications in the browser.
